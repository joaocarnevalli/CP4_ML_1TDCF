It can bring 3 different results.
* Normal Glucose
* Decreased Glucose
* Diabetes Mellitus

## Parameters
* **Normal Glucose**
    - Fasting:
        - less than 100mg/dL
    - Post Overload: 
        - Inferior a 140mg/dL
    - Casual blood glucose:
        - less than 200mg/dL
* **Decreased Glucose**
    - Fasting:
        - between 100 and 126 mg/dL
    - Post Overload: 
        - between 140 to 200mg/dL
    - Casual blood glucose:
        - less than 200mg/dL
* **Diabetes mellitus**
    - Fasting:
        - Greater than or equal to 126mg/dL
    - Post Overload:
        - Greater than or equal to 126mg/dL
    - Casual blood glucose:
        - greater than or equal to 200mg/dL
###### Fasting: No food intake for at least 8 hours
###### Post Overload: 2h after 75g of glucose
###### Casual blood glucose: Performed at any time of day
